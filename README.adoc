The Eternity Engine
===================

Eternity is an advanced http://doomwiki.org/wiki/Doom[DOOM] source
port maintained by James ``Quasar'' Haley, descended from Simon
``fraggle'' Howard's SMMU. It has a whole host of advanced features
for editors and players alike, including:

* http://doomwiki.org/wiki/ACS[ACS], including many of ZDoom's
  enhancements

* http://eternity.youfailit.net/index.php?title=EDF[EDF], Eternity
  Definition File, a language to define and modify monsters,
  decorations, sounds, text strings, menus, terrain types, and other
  kinds of data.

* http://doomwiki.org/wiki/ENDOOM[ENDOOM] and animated startup screen
  support.

* High-resolution support (practically unlimited).

* Support for _Master Levels_ and _No Rest for the Living_, allowing
  to play them without command line options.

* Portals which can be used to create skyboxes and fake 3D
  architecture. Linked portal allow objects to pass through them, as
  well.

* http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/[PNG] support

* Aided with http://libsdl.org/[SDL 2], Eternity is very portable and
  runs on a large range of operating systems: Windows (confirmed as
  low as XP, and all the way through Windows 10), Linux, Mac
  OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and more.

* Heretic, Hexen, and Strife support in-progress.

Eternity Engine is maintained using the Git version control system,
and the canonical source of the repository is available at
https://github.com/team-eternity/eternity[GitHub].

Compiling
---------
There are four ways available for building Eternity: CMake, Visual
Studio, Xcode files, and Homebrew, for Unix, Windows, and both
Mac OS X respectively.

Git submodule
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The project contains the ADLMIDI submodule. You need to load it after you've just cloned Eternity, by using this command:

----
git submodule update --init
----

Building with CMake (Unix OSes and Visual Studio 2017+)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CMake should be capable of generating build files for all platforms,
but it is most commonly used only for Unix OSes and Windows, and not
thoroughly tested outside of it.

. If you haven't already, extract the source *.zip file or clone the
Git repository, in the top-level directory you should see a
+CMakeLists.txt+ file. You should be in this directory.

. Create a new empty directory and change to it, eg: +mkdir build+
followed by +cd build+. You cannot do an in-tree build.

. If using Visual Studio make sure that you have installed the MFC
and ATL components for whatever version you are using.

. Run CMake. Usually you will want to run +cmake ..+, but you might
want to change the generator with a special command, for example:
+
----
cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\sdk\x64 -G "NMake Makefiles"
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizRel -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A "x64"
----

. Run your build tool. On Unix, you probably want to just run +make+.

As an optional final step, you can create a binary installation
package with CPack. For Windows, it will collect all the needed
runtime libraries and bundle it with the Eternity engine. Some
examples:

----
cpack -G ZIP
cpack -G DEB
cpack -G RPM
cpack -G STGZ
----

Building with CMake (macOS Xcode)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need Mac OS X 10.9 or more to run Eternity.

For macOS, currently only the Xcode generator is supported.

----
cmake .. -G Xcode
----

Or preferably use the CMake GUI app.

After that, open "Eternity Engine.xcodeproj". Inside it you'll have two targets of
interest:

. eternity: the direct game executable. Suitable for debugging the main game.
. EternityLauncher: the full app bundle. Suitable for release builds.

NOTE 1: CPack isn't currently supported on macOS for Eternity. Use the Xcode IDE to
produce a distributable app bundle.

NOTE 2: As of now, all SDL dependencies are downloaded during the CMake configuration
process. Eternity will _not_ link to whatever you may have installed to a central
location from Homebrew, other package managers or source-built.
