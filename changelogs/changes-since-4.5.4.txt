Changes since v4.05.04
======================

Features
--------
* Added support for the "author" property in UMAPINFO.
* Added DEMOLOOP id24 lump support.
* Added new ACS function: GiveInventory.
* Added a parameter to A_VileTarget codepointer: thing type to spawn (defaults to the one with Dehackednum 5, i.e.
  "VileFire" in Doom). Thanks to sink666 for the wish to have this parameter in the pull request.
* Made A_VileAttack codepointer paremeterized. Added the following args:
  - sound to play (default: sfx_barexp)
  - initial damage (default: 20)
  - blast damage (default: 70)
  - blast radius (default: 70)
  - thrust factor (default: 1.0)
  - damage type for initial hit (default: actor's MOD)
  - damage type for blast (default: actor's MOD)
  Thanks to sink666 for the wish to have parameters in the pull request.
* Added damage type (MOD) argument to A_BFGSpray (default: BFG_Splash).
* The ACS function TakeInventory has been heavily improved. Now, it can be used to take all types of items, as well 
  as health, armor, weapons, backpacks, and all types of power effects from the player. Also, if the function is 
  passed a amount of item that is greater than the player actually has, the item will be taken away completely 
  (previously, it was necessary to specify a number of items equal to what was in the player's inventory, which was a bug).

Bug fixes
---------
* Fixed A_BFGSpray not using the parameter, and always being locked at 40 rays.
* Fixed bad rendering of specially paletted PNG file for the Heretic episode 2 ending screen.
* Fixed A_CustomPlayerMelee wrong implementation of the angle deflection argument. Now it properly avoid rotating player
  if set to "none". Thanks to sink666's pull request for the catch.
