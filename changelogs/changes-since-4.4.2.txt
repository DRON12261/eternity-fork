Changes since v4.04.02
======================

Improvements
------------
* Automap improvements: now you can zoom in with the mouse wheel on the automap. You also have the
  option to hide all stats from both the automap and the overlay HUD, and hu_hidesecrets only hides
  secrets. Special thanks to SarahCosmosys for the contribution!
  + New console variable for this purpose: hu_hidestats.

* Now the 'gib' state of the crushed corpses is customizable in EDF in the following ways:
  + in EDF `thingtype`, using the `crunchstate` property;
  + in EDF `thingtype` DECORATE-style `state` definition, using either the `Crunch:` or `Crush:`
    label (the latter is on par with the name from ZDoom).
  If unspecified, it will default to the game mode behavior: change to S_GIBS in Doom, or do not
  change in Heretic. Thanks to sink666 for the implementation!


Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed crash happening when changing multithreaded rendering number of threads before demos start.
* Fixed sprite glitching shortly followed by crash when starting with multithreaded renderer on a
  small view, and then increasing the view.
* Fixed strange failure to start, happening on some Windows installations because of changes in the
  runtime.
  (issue here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78598141/first-stdmutexlock-crashes-in-application-built-with-latest-visual-studio)
* Fixed sudden termination due to "texture not cached" when playing back multiple level demos, or
  when the r_precache cvar was off.
* Dehacked patch Frame omitted Args* fields didn't resolve to defaults, but 0. This was wrong com-
  pared to how ports such as DSDA-DOOM should handle it.
* Fixed A_ConsumeAmmo bug when specifying 0 (ammo per shot) ammo.
* A_BFGSpray no longer crashes when used on a non-projectile thing which didn't acquire an enemy
  yet. This makes it compatible with vanilla DOOM Dehacked mods which can use this codepointer 
  liberally.
