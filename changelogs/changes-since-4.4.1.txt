Changes since v4.04.01
======================

Small improvements
------------------

* Confirmation yes/no views (such as for quitting) now accept non-QWERTY keyboard layouts for 'y' 
  and 'n', i.e. the same keys which under QWERTY would be 'y' or 'n' will also work.
* Do not terminate suddenly if user put flag names in the MBF21 flag codepointer. Just display an
  in-game error message with sound. Also, the message is more accurate.

Bug fixes
---------

* Fixed A_JumpIfFlagsSet as it was completely broken.
* Fixed wrong defaults in A_WeaponBulletAttack.
* A_SkullRodStorm wasn't line portal aware.
* Fixed UMAPINFO not recognizing spec-defined Deh_Actor_145 to Deh_Actor_249
* Multithreaded rendering now renders very wide sprites properly (such as the trees in Eviternity 2
  MAP14).
