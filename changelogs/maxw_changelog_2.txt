================================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v4.01.00
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/10/16
Increased visplane hash chain amount again, which should increase FPS in super
nasty scenes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/10/24
Added the ability to scale set the renderer's resolution independent of window
size.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/10/27
Default so that holding run whilst autorun is on makes you walk (runiswalk).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/03
Made the backbuffer everything is rendered to transposed. This improves
rendering times in some cases, and opens the door to many more optimisations.
The old quad buffer column drawer has been deleted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/08
Added tall patch support to masked columns (e.g.: sprites, masked midtexes).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/11
Added a provisional fix for intercept traversal when some intercepts are in
front of the player on the map, but behind them relatively (due to portals).
Made SetThingSpecial actually set the thing's special in addition to args.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/12
Fixed blockmap generation errors when the 0th vertex has the largest x or yo
co-ordinates.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/17
Fixed slope rendering in weird niche circumstances with high scale values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020/11/22
Fixed Eternity hard-locking if a dynavertex has the same position after
interpolation.

================================================================================
Changes since Eternity Engine v4.02.00
================================================================================

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/02/14
Added RANGEEIGHTH flag for thingtypes, required for Strife compat. It cuts
considered distance to target by eight, giving a way higher missile attack
probability.
Added spawn type param to A_FatAttack codepointers.
Made thing-based obituaries use deh or EDF strings if they start with $.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/02/15
Added cvar "hu_crosshair_scale" which can toggle scaling of the crosshair off or
on. It's saved in the config as "crosshair_scale".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/02/26
Fixed an issue where crushers would desync and permanently close when saving and
loading.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/03/04
Added an option to centre weapons when firing. It's in the weapons menu.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/03/07
Re-introduce a warning for potentially-incompatible savegames.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/03/21
Overhaul save and load menus. You can now have an arbitrary amount of savegames,
can delete selected savegames with the delete key, and info on the save like
when it was saved, what map it's on, etc. Saves in the list are sorted from most
recent to least recent. Quickload now allows you to select a quicksave slot if
one isn't already selected.
Credit goes to Devin Acker (Revenant) for the idea and initial code for that
ended up defining the layout and such that I went with for this.

Fixed the modern HUD being stretched horizontally.
Restricted the modern HUD to a 16:9 subscreen (if at 16:9 or wider aspect). Can
be toggled on/off with the cvar "hu_restrictoverlaywidth".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/04/02
Fixed screen going black when streaming on Discord.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/04/17
Allowed certain OPTIONS to be read at startup.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/04/17
Fixed Chainsaw and Fist not being switched away from if dehacked made them use
ammo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/05/10
Added sector actions for entering and leaving a sector, EESectorActionEnter and
EESectorActionExit. They have doomednum 9997 and 9998 respectively, the same as
ZDoom.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/04/19
Made the menus use the console font by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/05/22
Holding down weapon switch weapons no longer rotates between all weapons in that
slot automatically.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/09/25

   sounds maximum volume.

2021/11/25
[MBF21]
 * Added support for dehacked frame flags.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/11/28

by Roman Fomin, which removes the need for a separate MIDI playback application.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021/12/02
Added "meleerange" EDF property. It's a float, like radius and height.
Added "ripsound" EDF property, which is played when a ripper rips.
